Unit Testing
Pros
    Integrated with the software design process
    Catches the bugs as they are created
    Easy to tell what caused the test to fail
    Helps when refactoring (the test are still valid)

Cons
    Doesn't take into account the environment
    Doesn't test the interaction of modules
    Doesn't take into account real data
    Not really "independent" testing
    You only catch the bugs you think to test for
    It takes to much time
    Relies on the skill and thoroughness of the devloper

Integration Testing
Pros
    Takes into account the environment
    Tests the intaction among modules
    Can be independent

Cons
    Adds time to process
    Difficult to determine why a test failed
    Decoupled from the design process
